WS2801 library for AVR.

WS2801 is a common RGB LED driver. This library is a simple and lightweight
solution to control it.
No .h files here, just define required constants and inlcude .c file in your
code.

Example usage:
// Make sure that F_CPU is defined at this point
// Port where WS2801 is connected to (e.g PORTA, PORTC, etc...)
#define WS2801_OUT_PORT PORTA

// Pin number where 'clock' input of WS2801 is connected to, digit from 0 to 7
#define WS2801_CLK_PIN 0

// Pin number where 'data' input of WS2801 is connected to, digit from 0 to 7
#define WS2801_DATA_PIN 1

// Length of LED strip (in LEDs)
#define WS2801_STRIP_LEN 32

#include <ws2801/ws2801.c>

void let_there_be_light()
{
    // Adjust port registers (change to your port here)
    DDRA = (1 << WS2801_CLK_PIN) | (1 << WS2801_DATA_PIN)
    PORTA = (1 << WS2801_CLK_PIN) | (1 << WS2801_DATA_PIN)

    // Zeroing the strip
    ws2801_reset();

    // Light up all LED at half of power
    ws2801_set_brightness(128);
