  0. General Information
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The angular resolution is 0.0675 degree.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Usage
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1.1 General usage
By powering on the motordriver it comes up with its start
screen. Turning the rotary encoder serves to scroll through
the menu. Pressing the rotary encoder enters the selected menu.
Pressing the menu-escape-button leaves the menu again.

1.1.1 Display structure
In almost every menu one can see four displayed values, all of
them according to one's wished selection.
The upper left value accompanies to Motor 0.
The upper right value accompanies to Motor 1.
The lower left value accompanies to Motor 2.
The lower right value accompanies to Motor 3.

1.1.2 Motor selection
To select a motor there are four buttons. Motor selection can
solely be done in an entered menu. To select a motor, press the
respective motor-selection button. A selected motor is signed
with an arrow on the display. Pressing the selection-button
again deselects the motor.
Once a motor is selected its appropriated value can be changed
by turning the rotary encoder.
By leaving a menu without motor deselection the selectes motor(s)
stay selected in an other menu.

1.2 Menu: Change motor position
This menu gives information of the current motor position and
can change the motor position. The default unit is degree.
The position of a selected motor can be changed by turning the
rotary encoder. Default steps for different units are
  - 1° if unit is degree
  - 0.125*pi if unit is radian
  - 1 step is unit is steps

When pressing the rotary encoder in this menu one enters
the fast moving mode. Pressing the rotary encoder again leaves
the fast mode. The fast moving mode can be noticed by another
marking arrow. Default steps in fast mode are
  - 10° if unit is degree
  - 0.125*pi if unit is radian
  - 100 steps is unit is steps  

1.3 Menu: Change step unit
In this menu one can choose the displayed position unit. There
are three choices for each motor:
  - degree
  - radian
  - step

1.4 Menu: Change step wait time
Here the wait time between two steps can be changed. This
results in faster or slower motor movements. The default
value is 3 milliseconds.
We recommend to not get below this time even if this works.

1.5 Menu: Set step multiplier
In this menu one can adjust a step multiplier. The standard
value is 1.0. This results in an relative velocity reduction 
between the motors.
For example: if the step multiplier for motor 0 is 1.0
and the step multiplier for motor 2 is 4.0, motor 2 will
move four times slower than motor 0 when changing the
motors positions. Negative values are allowed as well.
This will result in counter direction movements.

1.6 Menu: Run zero calibration
Here one can calibrate the motor zero position for each
motor. To perform a zero calibration select the motors
to be calibrated and turn the rotary encoder. Note, that
during zero calibration no actions can be done on the
motordriver, even serial commands will not be accepted.
The zero calibration will automatically deselect a motor
when its calibration is finished. The zero calibration menu
will be automatically leaved when calibration is finished.

1.7 Menu: Change motor substeps
In this menu one can change the motor substeps.
CAUTION: this value must be changed on the DIP-switches
on the motordriver hardware output board. 

1.8 Menu: Save current configuration
To save the current motordriver configuration enter this menu
and turn the rotary encoder in any direction. The menu will
be automatically leaved when saving is finished.
Note: The configurations for all motors will be saved.

1.9 Menu: Load last configuration
To load the last saved motordriver configuration enter
this menu and turn the rotary encoder in any direction.
The menu will be leaved automatically when loading has
finished.
Note: The last saved configuration is loaded automaically
when powering on the motordriver.
Note: There is just one memory space for a configuration.

1.10 Menu: Define optical zero position
In this menu one can define the optical zero position. This
is necessary due to an mostly unknown placement of the optical
element mounted to the motor. Here one must adjust once the
wished optical zero position manually. After adjustment
it is recommended to save this configuration (see 1.8).
When now performing a zero calibration as explained in 1.6
the zero position will be the here defined optical zero position.

1.11 Menu: Set constant angular speed
Here the motors can be set into an infinite moving state in
clockwise (CW) or counter clockwise (CCW) state. To get the
motors moving with different velocities one must change the
wait times between two steps. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------
  2. Initial state and device access
-----------------------------------------------------------------

When powering on the motordriver the last saved configuration
will be loaded. This includes:
  - the optical zero position
  - the step multiplier
  - the adjusted step unit
  - the wait time between two steps
for all four motors.
When no configuration is saved the motordriver comes up in its
factory configuration. The factory configuration can be restored
with the FACTORYRESET command as described in chapter 4.

After power up the Motordriver is accessible via a serial port 
from a PC. The configuration of the RS232 interface is:
  - 57600 Baud
  - 8 bit character size
  - no parity bit
  - 1 stop bit
  - no flow control

  4. Instruction set
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Motordriver has the following commands which can be used. Note,
that the command parser is case sensitive. The command parameters,
denoted by <xxx>, must be separated by either SPACE or "," or ";"
or TAB. The command is completed by sending a CRLF or LF.

Command:  *RST
Function: Resets the motordriver to the initial state.
Example:  *RST

Command:  *IDN?
Function: Returnes the identification name of the motordriver.
Example:  *IDN?

Command:  *IDN <driver_idn>
Function: Sets the identification of the motordriver.
Note:     The maximum number of characters is 20.
Example:  *IDN NewName
          Sets the string "NewName" as IDN.

Command:  MOVEABS <mot> <pos> <unit>
Function: Moves motor <mot> to the absolute position <pos> <unit>
          The units can be steps, degree or radians.
Note:     The units must be written in lower case letters.
Example:  MOVEABS 0 22.5 deg
          MOVEABS 0 0.125 pi
		  MOVEABS 0 333 steps
          The examples do the same in different units.

Function: Moves motor <mot> relative to the current position
          The units can be steps, degree or radians.
Note:     The units must be written in lower case letters.
Example:  MOVEREL 2 22.5 deg
          MOVEREL 2 0.125 pi
          Both examples do the same in different units.

Command:  ZERORUN <mot>

Note:     During motor zero run no communication or usage
          of the motordriver is allowed.
Example:  ZERORUN 1
          Finds the mechanical zero position of motor 1

Command:  ENABLE <mot> <on/off>
Function: Turns motor <mot> on (1) or off (0)
Note:     Both for enabeling and disabeling of a motor
          the same command is used.
